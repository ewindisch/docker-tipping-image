Docker Build Tipper
--------------------

This docker image, when used as a base-image for your own images,
runs a couple minutes of bitcoin mining via CPU.

This only steals time from your 'docker build' and doesn't
affect running of the images themselves. The environment is fully
reset to an Ubuntu LTS image after the mining completes.

All proceeds benefit me, not you. Thanks!
